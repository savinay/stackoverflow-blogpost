## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I wanted to study the technology trends and how they have changed over years. I took the data from stackoverflow survey from 2011 to 2019 and tried to answer the following questions?

1. Growth of Women in Technology?
2. Most popular programming language?
3. Which country has the most developers?
4. Most popular Development Environment?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one single jupyter notebook that processes all the csv files and answers each of the questions mentioned in the Project Motivation section. The notebook is self-explanatory and markdown cells have been used to guide through the thought process.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@savinaynarendra/how-has-the-technology-industry-changed-over-years-c91cbdd24681).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  The data can be found [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
