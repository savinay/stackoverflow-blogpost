# stackoverflow-blogpost

For this project, I wanted to study the technology trends and how they have changed over years. I took the data from stackoverflow survey from 2011 to 2019 and tried to answer the following questions?

1. Growth of Women in Technology?
2. Most popular programming language?
3. Which country has the most developers?
4. Most popular Development Environment?

To find out more about the analysis, please go through the blogpost: https://medium.com/@savinaynarendra/how-has-the-technology-industry-changed-over-years-c91cbdd24681
